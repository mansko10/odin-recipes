    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These pineapple upside down cupcakes are great to make for family gatherings or as treats to pack into lunches. It's an easy recipe; adaptations can be made to make this completely from scratch. This is just a yummy simplified version!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>1/2 cup butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups brown sugar</li>
        <li>24 maraschino cherries</li>
        <li>1 (20 ounce) can crushed pineapple</li>
        <li>1 (18.25 ounce) package pineapple cake mix (such as Duncan HinesÂ® Pineapple Supreme)</li>
        <li>1 1/3 cups pineapple juice</li>
        <li>1/3 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar for dusting, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Move an oven rack to the middle of the oven. Spray 24 muffin cups with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Spoon 1 teaspoon melted butter into the bottom of each sprayed muffin cup. Spoon 1 tablespoon brown sugar into each muffin cup. Press a maraschino cherry into the center of the brown sugar in each muffin cup. Spoon a heaping tablespoon of crushed pineapple on top and compact it with the back of a spoon into an even layer.</li>
        <li>Mix pineapple cake mix, pineapple juice, vegetable oil, and eggs in a large bowl with an electric mixer on low speed until moistened, about 30 seconds. Increase speed to medium; mix for 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour batter into the muffin cups, filling them to the top; do not overfill.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean, about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Line a work surface with waxed paper. Allow cupcakes to cool at least 5 minutes before inverting muffin cups onto the waxed paper; serve with pineapple and cherry sides up. Sprinkle cupcakes lightly with confectioners' sugar before serving.</li>
    </ol>
